## Technical Debt Assessment

### Current Technical Debt

**Total Technical Debt Score:** 15 points (LOW) 🟢

| Item | Type | Severity | Effort | Status |
|------|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Stories 1.8 and 1.9 incomplete | Missing Feature | Medium | 6-8h | 📋 Planned |

## Quality Gate Decisions

### Epic 1 Overall Gate Status

**Gate Decision:** **PASS WITH CONDITIONS** ⚠️

**Conditions for Epic 2 Start:**
1. ✅ Core infrastructure validated (Stories 1.1-1.7)
2. ⚠️ **Complete Story 1.8** (n8n required for Epic 2 workflows)
3. ⚠️ **Complete Story 1.9** (shared types needed for Epic 2)

**Waiver Option:** Stories 1.8 and 1.9 can be completed in parallel with Epic 2.1-2.3 if necessary, but must be done before Story 2.4+.

## Story-Level Quality Gates

### Completed Stories (Detailed Review Required)

| Story | Files to Review | Priority |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| 1.1 | ✅ Already reviewed | - |
| 1.2 | Railway PostgreSQL config, extensions | High |
| 1.3 | Database schema, migrations, types | High |
| 1.4 | PostgREST config, Dockerfile | High |
| 1.5 | NextJS app, Tailwind, shadcn/ui | High |
| 1.6 | Docker Compose, local env | Medium |
| 1.7 | Health dashboard UI | Medium |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Epic 2)

1. **HIGH PRIORITY** - Complete comprehensive QA reviews for Stories 1.2-1.7
2. **HIGH PRIORITY** - Implement Story 1.8 (n8n configuration)
3. **HIGH PRIORITY** - Implement Story 1.9 (shared types package)
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Create quality gate YAML files for all completed stories

### Quality Improvements

1. Add `.nvmrc` file for Node.js version management
2. Add `.editorconfig` for IDE consistency
3. Consider adding Husky for pre-commit hooks
4. Document Railway deployment procedures

### Epic 2 Readiness

**Status:** Ready to begin once Stories 1.8 and 1.9 are complete.

**Epic 2 Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Database schema in place
- ✅ PostgREST API available
- ✅ NextJS frontend initialized
- ⚠️ n8n workflow engine (Story 1.8)
- ⚠️ Shared TypeScript types (Story 1.9)
