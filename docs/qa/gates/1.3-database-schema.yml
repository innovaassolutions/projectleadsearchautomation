# Quality Gate Decision: Story 1.3 - Database Schema
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "1.3"
story_title: "Create Initial Database Schema"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent SQL implementation with complete feature coverage, but migration runner lacks state tracking and transaction safety. Security concerns around missing RLS policies and unencrypted sensitive data. Recommend addressing before next migration."

# NFR Validation Results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Missing RLS policies and sensitive data encryption. UUID keys and FK constraints are good. Need SSL connection documentation."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent index strategy with HNSW, GIN, and partial indexes. HNSW parameters (m=16, ef_construction=64) are optimal."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Migration runner lacks transaction safety and state tracking. Rollback scripts exist but no verification. FK CASCADE is correct."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization, clear comments, comprehensive README. 100% alignment with architecture doc."

# Positive Highlights
strengths:
  - "Excellent SQL code quality with clear organization and comments"
  - "100% alignment with architecture documentation"
  - "Optimal index strategy using HNSW, GIN, and partial indexes"
  - "Comprehensive README with usage examples"
  - "All 10 acceptance criteria fully implemented"
  - "Proper foreign key CASCADE for referential integrity"
  - "Smart use of check constraints for data validation"

# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Gate status is CONCERNS (not FAIL) because:

  1. All functional requirements are met - schema is complete and correct
  2. Migration has been successfully applied to both local and Railway databases
  3. SQL quality is excellent with proper indexes, constraints, and organization
  4. Issues identified are fixable without modifying the applied migration

  The HIGH severity issues (state tracking, transactions, RLS) are important but:
  - Can be addressed in future migrations (002, 003)
  - Don't break existing functionality
  - Are standard technical debt for MVP phase

  This is solid foundation work that merits moving forward with awareness
  of improvements needed before production launch.
