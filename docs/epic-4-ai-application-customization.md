# Epic 4: AI-Powered Application Customization

> **Phase**: 1 (MVP)
> **Estimated Time**: 3-4 weeks
> **Must Complete Before**: Epic 5 (Application Submission & Tracking)
> **Depends On**: Epic 3 (Application Project Management & Matching)
> **Status**: Not Started
> **Stories**: 10

---

## Overview

Implement comprehensive template management system for resumes and cover letters, build OpenAI-powered customization engine that generates tailored application materials for each job, create A/B testing framework to compare different resume versions, implement quality control workflows with automated scoring, build template editor UI with preview capabilities, establish version history and rollback functionality, create template library for importing proven templates, and implement bulk testing workflow for quality assurance.

**Why This Matters**: AI-powered customization is the core value proposition that enables high-volume, high-quality applications. Without intelligent resume and cover letter generation, users would need to manually customize each application, defeating the purpose of automation. The A/B testing and quality scoring ensure generated materials maintain professional standards at scale.

---

## Epic Goal

Deploy a complete AI-powered application customization system that allows users to manage master resume and cover letter templates, automatically generate job-specific customized versions using OpenAI GPT-4o, test different resume strategies with A/B testing, ensure quality through automated scoring, preview and regenerate materials before submission, and track version historyâ€”all while maintaining professional quality standards across hundreds of applications.

---

## Technical Dependencies

**Epic 3 Completion**:
- Application projects with matched jobs available
- Matching engine providing job candidates for customization

**Database Schema**:
- `resume_templates` table
- `cover_letter_templates` table
- `resume_ab_tests` table
- `customization_versions` table
- `bulk_test_batches` and `bulk_test_results` tables
- Additional columns in `applications` table

**External Services**:
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o for customization)
- Grammar checking API (optional, for quality scoring)

**Infrastructure**:
- n8n workflows for batch processing
- Sufficient OpenAI API rate limits
- Storage for version history

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: OpenAI API costs exceed budget ($0.10 per application)
- **Mitigation**: Use GPT-4o-mini for initial drafts, GPT-4o only for final version; implement caching
- **Fallback**: Use template with variable substitution; manual customization

**Risk**: AI generates fabricated content (hallucinations)
- **Mitigation**: Strict validation; compare generated content against original template; user review required
- **Fallback**: Flag suspicious content; require manual review for low-quality scores

**Risk**: Generated materials are generic or low-quality
- **Mitigation**: Implement quality scoring; use few-shot prompting; A/B test different approaches
- **Fallback**: Regenerate with different parameters; allow manual editing

**Risk**: Users don't review generated materials (over-trust automation)
- **Mitigation**: Default to Semi Auto mode requiring review; show quality scores prominently
- **Fallback**: Force preview step before submission; periodic quality audits

**Risk**: A/B testing doesn't reach statistical significance (insufficient sample size)
- **Mitigation**: Require minimum 20 applications per variant; show confidence intervals
- **Fallback**: Use qualitative review; disable A/B testing if sample size insufficient

---
