# Epic 3: Application Project Management & Matching

> **Phase**: 1 (MVP)
> **Estimated Time**: 3-4 weeks
> **Must Complete Before**: Epic 4 (AI-Powered Application Customization)
> **Depends On**: Epic 2 (Job Discovery & Enrichment Pipeline)
> **Status**: Not Started
> **Stories**: 10

---

## Overview

Enable users to create and manage Application Projects with sophisticated configurable criteria (salary range, job titles, industries, seniority levels, automation mode), implement intelligent job matching engine using both keyword-based filtering and pgvector semantic similarity, create learning system that suggests criteria reuse based on previous successful projects, build comprehensive project management UI with bulk actions and templates, and establish matching association table to track job-project relationships.

**Why This Matters**: Application Projects are the core organizational unit that drives the entire automation system. Without proper project management and intelligent matching, users cannot effectively target specific job types, and the system cannot automate applications efficiently. The semantic matching ensures high-quality matches beyond simple keyword filtering.

---

## Epic Goal

Deploy a complete Application Project management system that allows users to define job search criteria across multiple dimensions, automatically match incoming jobs using hybrid keyword + semantic similarity algorithms, learn from successful application patterns, and manage multiple concurrent projects with different automation modesâ€”all accessible through an intuitive UI.

### Story 3.3: Keyword-Based Job Matching Engine

**As a** system
**I want** to match jobs against project criteria using keyword filtering
**So that** jobs meeting explicit user requirements are automatically associated with projects

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] n8n workflow created: "Keyword Job Matching"
- [ ] Workflow triggered after job enrichment completes (Story 2.6)
- [ ] Workflow fetches all active application projects
- [ ] For each project, apply keyword filters:
  - Salary: job salary >= project min AND <= project max (if specified)
  - Job titles: job title contains any project title (case-insensitive)
  - Industries: job industry matches any project industry
  - Seniority: job seniority matches any project seniority level
  - Job types: job type matches any project job type
  - Required skills: job tags contain ALL required skills
  - Nice-to-have skills: job tags contain ANY nice-to-have (bonus points)
- [ ] Matching logic uses SQL WHERE clauses with PostgREST filtering
- [ ] Calculate match score (0-100):
  - Base: 50 points (all required criteria met)
  - +10 for each nice-to-have skill matched (max +30)
  - +10 for salary within ideal range (75-100% of max)
  - +10 for exact seniority match
- [ ] Matches stored in `job_project_matches` table:
  - Columns: `id`, `job_id`, `project_id`, `match_score`, `match_type` ('keyword'), `matched_at`
- [ ] Workflow logs matching statistics per project
- [ ] Duplicate matches prevented (check existing matches)
- [ ] Workflow exported to `/apps/n8n-workflows/keyword-matching.json`

**Technical Notes**:
- Use PostgreSQL array operators for skill matching (@>, &&)
- Use pg_trgm for fuzzy job title matching
- Optimize with database indexes on match criteria columns
- Consider batch processing (match 100 jobs at once)

**Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours

---

### Story 3.4: Semantic Job Matching with pgvector

**As a** system
**I want** to match jobs using semantic similarity in addition to keywords
**So that** relevant jobs are discovered even when keyword criteria don't perfectly align

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] n8n workflow created: "Semantic Job Matching"
- [ ] Workflow triggered after keyword matching completes
- [ ] For each active project, generate "ideal job embedding":
  - Concatenate: project description + job titles + required skills
  - Call OpenAI Embeddings API (text-embedding-ada-002)
  - Store embedding in `application_projects` table (new column: `ideal_job_embedding vector(1536)`)
- [ ] Query pgvector for semantically similar jobs:
  - SQL: `SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE embedding <=> project_embedding < 0.3 ORDER BY embedding <=> project_embedding LIMIT 50`
  - Cosine similarity threshold: 0.3 (adjustable)
- [ ] Calculate semantic match score:
  - Convert cosine distance to similarity: (1 - distance) * 100
  - Example: distance 0.2 = 80% similarity
- [ ] Store semantic matches in `job_project_matches`:
  - `match_type`: 'semantic'
  - `match_score`: semantic similarity percentage
- [ ] Combine with keyword matches:
  - If job has both keyword + semantic match, use higher score
  - Add bonus: +10 points for hybrid match
- [ ] Update match score in database
- [ ] Workflow logs semantic matching statistics
- [ ] Test semantic matching finds relevant jobs missed by keywords
- [ ] Workflow exported to `/apps/n8n-workflows/semantic-matching.json`

**Technical Notes**:
- pgvector extension required (from Epic 1)
- Use HNSW index for fast approximate similarity search
- Tune similarity threshold based on precision/recall tradeoff
- Cache project embeddings (regenerate only on criteria change)

**Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours

---

### Story 3.5: Job-Project Matching Association Table

**As a** developer
**I want** a dedicated table to track job-project match relationships
**So that** the system can efficiently query matched jobs and track match history

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Database migration created: `003_job_project_matches.sql`
- [ ] Table created: `job_project_matches`
  - Columns:
    - `id` (UUID, primary key)

    - `match_score` (integer, 0-100)
    - `match_type` (enum: 'keyword', 'semantic', 'hybrid')
    - `matched_at` (timestamp with time zone)
    - `reviewed` (boolean, default false)
    - `dismissed` (boolean, default false)
- [ ] Composite unique index: `(job_id, project_id)` (prevent duplicates)
- [ ] Index on `project_id, match_score DESC` (for sorted queries)
- [ ] Index on `match_type` (for filtering)
- [ ] Foreign key constraints with CASCADE on delete
- [ ] Default values set appropriately
- [ ] Migration applied to Railway database
- [ ] PostgREST endpoint verified: `GET /job_project_matches`
- [ ] Test queries:

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: Matching engine generates too many false positives (low-quality matches)
- **Mitigation**: Tune match score thresholds; implement user feedback loop to adjust criteria
- **Fallback**: Allow users to adjust match sensitivity per project

**Risk**: Semantic matching performance degrades with large datasets
- **Mitigation**: Use HNSW index; pre-filter by keywords before semantic search
- **Fallback**: Make semantic matching optional; rely primarily on keyword matching

**Risk**: Criteria autocomplete suggestions are not helpful
- **Mitigation**: Aggregate from existing job data; weight by frequency and recency
- **Fallback**: Allow free-text entry without autocomplete

**Risk**: Learning system suggests irrelevant criteria (not enough data)
- **Mitigation**: Require minimum 10 applications before showing suggestions
- **Fallback**: Allow manual criteria entry; disable suggestions if data insufficient

**Risk**: Bulk operations timeout on large selections (100+ jobs)
- **Mitigation**: Implement batch processing with progress indicators; limit to 50 jobs per action
- **Fallback**: Process in background; notify user when complete

---

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Users create average 2-3 active projects
- âœ… Matching engine finds 20-50 relevant jobs per project per day
- âœ… Match score accuracy: 80%+ of high-scoring matches (>80) are relevant
