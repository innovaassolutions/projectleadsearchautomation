# Story 1.2: Deploy PostgreSQL with Extensions

> **Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure
> **Status**: Done
> **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

---

## User Story

**As a** developer
**I want** PostgreSQL deployed on Railway with required extensions
**So that** I can store application data with vector search capabilities

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] PostgreSQL 15+ service created on Railway (PostgreSQL 17 deployed)
- [x] Database extensions enabled:
  - `uuid-ossp` v1.1 (UUID generation)
  - `pg_trgm` v1.6 (full-text search)
  - `pgvector` v0.8.1 (semantic embeddings)
- [x] Database connection string retrieved from Railway
- [x] Railway environment variable `DATABASE_URL` configured
- [x] Connection pooling configured (100 connections - exceeds 10-20 requirement)
- [x] Remote database connection tested from local machine
- [x] Automated daily backups verified active (Railway default)
- [x] Database credentials secured (not in code, stored in .env.local which is gitignored)

---

## Technical Notes

- pgvector extension required for semantic job matching (Epic 2)
- Use Railway's PostgreSQL service for managed hosting
- Document connection string format for team reference

---

## Tasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create PostgreSQL Service on Railway**
  - [x] 1.1 Create PostgreSQL 17 service via Railway pgvector template
  - [x] 1.2 Configure connection pooling (100 connections default)
  - [x] 1.3 Verify automated daily backups are active
  - [x] 1.4 Retrieve database connection string

- [x] **Task 2: Enable Required Extensions**
  - [x] 2.1 Connect to Railway PostgreSQL database
  - [x] 2.2 Enable `uuid-ossp` extension
  - [x] 2.3 Enable `pg_trgm` extension
  - [x] 2.4 Enable `pgvector` extension
  - [x] 2.5 Verify all extensions are installed

- [x] **Task 3: Configure Environment Variables**
  - [x] 3.1 Set `DATABASE_URL` in Railway environment variables
  - [x] 3.2 Test connection from local machine
  - [x] 3.3 Document connection string format
  - [x] 3.4 Verify credentials are secured (not in code)

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] PostgreSQL service running on Railway
- [x] All required extensions installed and verified
- [x] Connection tested successfully from local machine
- [x] Credentials documented securely

### Debug Log References
- None

### Completion Notes
- Deployed PostgreSQL 17 with pgvector using Railway's official template (pgvector-pg17)
- All three required extensions successfully enabled: uuid-ossp v1.1, pg_trgm v1.6, vector v0.8.1
- Connection pooling set to 100 connections (Railway default, exceeds minimum requirement)
- Railway automated daily backups verified active (default for all Railway PostgreSQL services)
- Database credentials stored in .env.local (gitignored, not committed to repository)
- Connection tested successfully from local machine using psql client

### File List
- `.env.local` - Updated DATABASE_URL and PGRST_DB_URI with new Railway pgvector connection strings
- `infra/railway/Dockerfile.postgres` - Created custom PostgreSQL Dockerfile (not used, kept for reference)
- `infra/railway/README.md` - Created deployment documentation for PostgreSQL with pgvector

### Change Log
- 2025-10-21: Initial PostgreSQL deployment attempted (missing pgvector extension)
- 2025-10-21: Redeployed using Railway pgvector-pg17 template
- 2025-10-21: Enabled all required extensions (uuid-ossp, pg_trgm, vector)
- 2025-10-21: Updated environment variables in .env.local
- 2025-10-21: Verified connection and extensions from local machine
