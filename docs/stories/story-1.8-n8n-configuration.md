## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Source References**:
- Tech Stack: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- Backend Architecture: `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`
- Project Structure: `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`

This story deploys the **n8n workflow automation engine** which is a critical component of the backend infrastructure. n8n will be used in Epic 2+ for:
- Job scraping workflows (Remote OK, WWR, Himalayas, YC Jobs, Wellfound)
- AI enrichment orchestration (OpenAI API integration)
- Email monitoring and response tracking
- Interview preparation automation
- Error handling and alerting

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 1.7 (Health Dashboard)**:
- Railway deployment is straightforward - services connect via internal networking
- Environment variables are managed through Railway dashboard
- PostgreSQL is already deployed and accessible at Railway internal URLs
- Local Docker Compose environment mirrors Railway setup
- Health monitoring approach can be extended to check n8n service status

**From Story 1.6 (Local Development Environment)**:
- Docker Compose file already includes n8n service configuration
- n8n is configured to use PostgreSQL for workflow persistence
- Local setup uses basic auth with `admin` / `localdev123`
- Port 5678 is mapped for local n8n access
- Volume `n8n-data` persists workflows between container restarts

### Railway Deployment Configuration

**[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]**

Technology: **n8n** (Latest version)
- Visual workflow automation platform
- 300+ integrations available
- Self-hosted solution (no Zapier costs)

**Railway Service Setup**:
1. Create new service from Docker image: `n8nio/n8n:latest`
2. Configure environment variables (see Task 1.3 for complete list)
3. Connect to existing PostgreSQL service via Railway internal networking
4. Expose port 5678 for web interface
5. Railway will provide public HTTPS URL automatically

**Database Connection**:
- n8n uses PostgreSQL for workflow and credential persistence
- Railway PostgreSQL connection uses internal network (not public URL)
- Database: `jobapp` (same database as application data)
- n8n creates its own tables automatically on first startup

### n8n Workflow Engine Overview

**[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]**

n8n is part of the **hybrid backend architecture**:
- PostgREST: Auto-generated REST API
- Next.js API Routes: Custom business logic
- **n8n Workflows**: Orchestration and automation

**Key Workflows Planned for Epic 2+**:
1. Job Scraping (runs every 4 hours)
2. AI Customization (webhook trigger from frontend)
3. Email Monitoring (runs every 5 minutes)
4. Interview Prep (triggered by calendar webhook)
5. Error Handler (global error handling)

### Environment Variables Required

**Railway Production**:
```bash
# Authentication
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=<secure-username>      # Generate unique username
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=<secure-password>  # Generate strong password (20+ chars)

# Host Configuration
N8N_HOST=<railway-public-url>              # e.g., n8n-production-abc123.railway.app
N8N_PORT=5678
N8N_PROTOCOL=https
WEBHOOK_URL=<railway-public-url>/webhook   # Full webhook URL

# Database Connection (PostgreSQL persistence)
DB_TYPE=postgresdb
DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<railway-postgres-internal-url>  # e.g., postgres.railway.internal
DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=5432
DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=jobapp
DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<railway-postgres-user>
DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<railway-postgres-password>
```

**Local Development** (already configured in `docker-compose.yml`):
```yaml
environment:
  - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
  - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
  - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=localdev123
  - DB_TYPE=postgresdb
  - DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=postgres
  - DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=5432
  - DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=jobapp
  - DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=postgres
  - DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=localdev123
  - N8N_HOST=localhost
  - N8N_PORT=5678
  - N8N_PROTOCOL=http
  - WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:5678/
```

```

### Webhook Configuration

**Webhook URL Structure**:
- Production: `https://<railway-url>/webhook/<workflow-path>`
- Local: `http://localhost:5678/webhook/<workflow-path>`

**Security Considerations**:
- Webhooks are public endpoints (no auth by default)
- For production workflows, implement webhook authentication:
  - Use n8n's built-in "Header Auth" for webhook nodes
  - Verify custom header: `X-N8N-Webhook-Secret: <secret-value>`
  - Store secret in Railway environment variables

### "Hello World" Workflow Specification

**Workflow Structure**:
1. **Webhook Trigger Node**:
   - HTTP Method: GET
   - Path: `/test-webhook`
   - Authentication: None (test only)
   - Response Mode: Immediately

2. **HTTP Request Node**:
   - URL: `https://api.github.com/zen`
   - Method: GET
   - Purpose: Fetch random GitHub Zen quote

3. **Respond to Webhook Node**:
   - Response Body (JSON):
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Hello World",
     "github_zen": "{{$json.data}}",
     "timestamp": "{{$now}}"
   }
   ```

**Testing Command**:
```bash
# Test production webhook
curl https://<railway-n8n-url>/webhook/test-webhook

# Expected response:
{
  "message": "Hello World",
  "github_zen": "Design for failure.",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-26T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Workflow Persistence

**How n8n Stores Workflows**:
- n8n creates database tables in PostgreSQL automatically on first startup
- Tables created: `n8n_workflow`, `n8n_execution`, `n8n_credentials`
- Workflows are stored as JSON in `n8n_workflow` table
- Credentials (API keys, etc.) are encrypted in `n8n_credentials` table
- Execution history stored in `n8n_execution` for debugging

**Workflow Export/Import**:
- Workflows can be exported as JSON files for version control
- Store workflow exports in `/apps/n8n-workflows/` directory
- Commit workflow JSON files to git for team sharing
- Import workflows in new environments for consistency

### Testing Requirements

**[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]**

For this infrastructure story, testing is primarily **manual verification**:

1. **Service Health Check**:
   - Verify n8n service is running on Railway
   - Check Railway logs for startup errors
   - Confirm n8n web interface loads

2. **Authentication Test**:
   - Test basic auth login works
   - Verify credentials are secure (not in code)

3. **Workflow Execution Test**:
   - Create "Hello World" workflow
   - Test webhook endpoint with curl
   - Verify response is correct

4. **Persistence Test**:
   - Restart n8n service
   - Verify workflows survive restart
   - Confirm database connection working

5. **Export/Import Test**:
   - Export workflow to JSON
   - Import workflow from JSON
   - Verify imported workflow is identical

**No unit tests required** for this story (infrastructure configuration only).

### Coding Standards

**[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]**

Not directly applicable (no code written), but follow these conventions:

**File Naming**:
- Workflow exports: kebab-case (e.g., `hello-world.json`, `job-scraper.json`)
- Documentation: kebab-case (e.g., `workflow-automation.md`)

**Git Commits**:
```bash
# Use conventional commit format:
feat(infra): deploy n8n workflow engine on Railway
docs(n8n): add workflow automation documentation
```

### Security Checklist

- [ ] **Credentials Not in Code**: All passwords stored in Railway environment variables
- [ ] **Strong Authentication**: Basic auth enabled with secure username/password
- [ ] **Database Connection Secured**: Using Railway internal networking (not public)
- [ ] **HTTPS Enabled**: Railway provides HTTPS automatically for production
- [ ] **Webhook Security**: Document how to add authentication to production webhooks

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: n8n service fails to start on Railway**
- Check Railway logs for error messages
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Confirm PostgreSQL connection details are correct (host, user, password)
- Check if n8n port 5678 is exposed

**Issue: Cannot access n8n web interface**
- Verify Railway service has a public URL assigned
- Check if service is running (Railway dashboard shows "Active")
- Test URL in browser with HTTPS (not HTTP)
- Confirm basic auth credentials are correct

**Issue: Workflows don't persist after restart**
- Check PostgreSQL connection is working
- Verify `DB_TYPE=postgresdb` is set
- Check Railway logs for database connection errors
- Confirm n8n created tables in PostgreSQL (`SELECT * FROM n8n_workflow`)

**Issue: Webhook returns 404 Not Found**
- Verify workflow is activated (toggle in n8n dashboard)
- Check webhook path matches URL you're testing
- Confirm webhook node is configured correctly
- Test webhook URL matches `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable

### Performance Considerations

- n8n runs in-memory, requires ~512MB RAM minimum
- PostgreSQL connection pooling handled automatically by n8n
- Workflow executions stored for 7 days by default (configurable)
- Webhook responses should be <500ms for simple workflows

- **When** I access n8n via Railway URL with credentials
- **Then** I should see the n8n dashboard ✅
- **And** Hello World workflow should be active ✅
- **And** Webhook should respond successfully ✅
- **And** Workflows should persist after restart ✅
- **But** Credentials should not be exposed in version control ✗

### Gate Status

**Gate:** ✗ **FAIL** → [docs/qa/gates/1.8-n8n-configuration.yml](docs/qa/gates/1.8-n8n-configuration.yml)

**Quality Score:** 20/100
- Calculation: 100 - (20 × 3 high severity issues) - (10 × 1 medium severity issue) = 20

**Risk Profile:**
- **Highest Risk:** Security (High probability × High impact = 9/10)
- **Critical Issues:** 0
- **High Severity:** 3 (credential exposure)
- **Medium Severity:** 1 (webhook auth documentation)
- **Low Severity:** 0

**NFR Assessment:**
- Security: ✗ FAIL
- Performance: ✓ PASS
- Reliability: �� PASS
- Maintainability: ✓ PASS

### Recommended Status

✗ **Changes Required** - Security remediation mandatory before approval

**Blocking Issues:**
1. Remove all hardcoded production credentials from documentation
2. Rotate exposed credentials in Railway dashboard
3. Implement git-secrets or similar pre-commit scanning

**Why This Matters:**
The exposed credentials provide full access to production n8n and the PostgreSQL database for anyone with repository access (or if repository becomes public). This is a critical security vulnerability (CWE-798) that must be resolved before production use.

**Positive Notes:**
The functional implementation is excellent - comprehensive documentation, proper architecture, verified persistence, and clear operational procedures. Once the security issues are remediated, this will be production-ready.

### Files Modified During Review

**Created:**
- [docs/qa/gates/1.8-n8n-configuration.yml](docs/qa/gates/1.8-n8n-configuration.yml) - Quality gate decision with detailed security findings

**No code refactoring performed** - This is an infrastructure/documentation story. Security fixes are required in documentation files only.

---

**Next Steps for Developer:**
1. Address all three credential exposure issues (SEC-001, SEC-002, SEC-003)
2. Rotate credentials in Railway dashboard immediately
3. Re-run QA review after fixes are committed
4. Consider adding git-secrets to prevent future issues
