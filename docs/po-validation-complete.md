- **Before**: Wait 6 months for any usable system
- **After**: Working MVP in 6-8 weeks

### Risk Reduction
- Validate core value proposition early
- Iterate based on real usage data
- Avoid over-engineering unused features

### Resource Efficiency
- Focus developer time on highest-value features
- Defer automation until manual workflow proven
- Optimize costs incrementally

### Flexibility
- Pivot quickly if assumptions wrong
- Add features based on user feedback
- Scale complexity only when needed
